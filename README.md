# How to use it

This _SHOULD_ work without you having to anything at all, except a couple of stuff:

1. Run `composer global require php-stubs/acf-pro-stubs` to install acf-pro-stubs in case you dont have them and make sure the paths they're installed to (you can check it with `composer global show`), is the same as specified in the `init.lua` in the `intelephense` part
