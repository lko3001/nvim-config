# How to use it

This _SHOULD_ work without you having to anything at all, except a couple of stuff:

1. Run `composer global require php-stubs/acf-pro-stubs` to install acf-pro-stubs in case you dont have them and make sure the paths they're installed to (you can check it with `composer global show`), is the same as specified in the `init.lua` in the `intelephense` part

Also in `:Mason` I have installed these:
- ast-grep ast_grep
- bash-language-server bashls
- biome
- clang-format
- clangd
- css-lsp cssls
- djlint
- easy-coding-standard
- emmet-language-server emmet_language_server
- intelephense
- json-lsp jsonls
- lua-language-server lua_ls
- markdownlint
- markdownlint-cli2
- pyright
- stylua
- typescript-language-server tsserver
- vue-language-server volar
- yapf
